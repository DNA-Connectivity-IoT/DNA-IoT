DNA offers connectivity for IoT devices to send data to cloud providers. DNA Control Center is tool that allows you to centrally manage your connectivity assets. 

In order to make the usage of these services easier for cloud developers, in this repo is presented ways to integrate the DNA Control Center to cloud services. The data about the connectivity is brought to cloud where it can be used to monitor, analyze and act upon. This brings the connectivity one step closer to developers. 

Currently two integrations templates are build. They can be found under the folders in this repo. Azure is at the moment under construction, but we are bulding it as you are reading this so updates coming soon.

# DNA Control Center Azure connection

DNA offers connectivity for IoT devices to send data to cloud providers. DNA Control Center is tool that allows you to centrally manage your connectivity assets. Azure is major cloud provider that has many services, including ones that help build IoT connected devices. 

With the following instructions we connect a device to Azure cloud by utilizing DNA connectivity and integrate DNA Control Center generated statistics and connectivity status to Azure services. The instructions are built so that with little customization different sensors, gateways or DNA Control Center statistics (different with the ones in this demo) can be taken into action.
